## Summary

Reporter for mocha tests which prints the test statuses in a
hierarchical manner. This reporter is based on the `spec` reporter
provided by mocha. There are a few differences between this and `spec`:

- A failing test has a `x` in front of it. The failing index suffix has
  been moved to the end of line.

![Example report of failing tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anshulverma/mocha-hierarchical-reporter/development/images/failing-tests.png "Report of failing tests")

- The failures are reported in the end as in `spec`. The only difference
  is the name of the failed tests is shown in a hierarchy.

- Object diff is reported properly with a deep colored diff of its
  contents.

## Installation

Install using `npm` and save it as a development dependency:

> npm install hierarchical-reporter --save-dev

## Usage

Simply use the `--reporter` CLI option to specify the reporter you want
to use:

> mocha --reporter hierarchical-reporter test/*.js

## Building

To get the js source generated form coffee script:

``` bash
$ grunt coffee
```

This will put all js files in `lib` folder.

## Testing

To execute tests, make sure
[grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) is installed. Then run:

``` bash
$ grunt test
```

Before testing, this task will perform a lint check using
[coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org/).  Tests will be executed if and
only if linting succeeds.

The `default` task of `grunt` will run this command as well. So, just
typing `grunt` and pressing RET is also sufficient to run tests.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using
[docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco) and placed in `docs`
folder. To build documentation:

``` bash
$ grunt docs
```

## Build + Test + Document

The `build` task of `grunt` will check linting, test everything,
generate docs and build javascript source. So, to execute:

``` bash
$ grunt build
```
